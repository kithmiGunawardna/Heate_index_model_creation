# Arema Model for Heat Index Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains code to predict the 12 months heat index using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The model utilizes two datasets: temperature and humidity, spanning from 2012 to 2018. The predictions were made for the year 2019.
